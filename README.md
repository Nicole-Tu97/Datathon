# Objective:
Select five top players. The players should, ideally, excel in all areas of the game. Since scoring goals is the ultimate objective, at least three should be excellent goal scorers(3 goal most) and at least two should be excellent passers(2 play most).  In addition, you need at least two faceoff (2 face-off win most) specialists and one takeaway specialist (1 takeaway often).  It would be especially beneficial if the passers were familiar with the shooting specialists (given player1 play most, player 2 is among 3 goal most) (i.e., had a good track record of completing passes to these players).
